# The-OOPs-Challenge
Classes and objects
What my Application does?
--> It contains a python code which is a code for task given.
--> Code contains Car class with collision detection and time-to-collision calculation implemented using coordinates and     speeds.
--> Code asks the user to input the attributes(properties) of Car1 and Car2.
--> It also asks to increment/decrement the speed of cars.
--> Finally it prints detect collision and time to collision.
Concepts Used:
--> OOPs(Object Oriented Programming)
--> It helps in solving real world problems.
--> It easily helps in converting real world problem to program code to solve.
